This is fan made translation provided by me! Giratena2008.
To patch the game, please move "game.exe" and "data.dts" in this 
folder into the source game folder. 

To add the extra voices for Mileena, Cherish, Luminara, and Alice,
Unzip the file named 追加ボイス.zip, and place the contents in
Materials > Voice. These characters will now have voiced dialogue!
(There are multple zips files. Unzip them all and place the contents in the voice folder)

As of now, Ch1~10 has been translated!

If you have any bugs/typos to report, or if you'd like to support the translation,
please let me know on the translation discord server!-> https://discord.gg/rxsQSPZ

You can also view translation progress on github:

If you enjoy the English translation, I hope you'll consider supporting me on
either discord or patreon being a solo translator is tough, so any help
at all is appreciated and helps me work on translations more ^^

With all that said, hope you enjoy the game, and enjoy the translation! ^^ -Giratena2008
